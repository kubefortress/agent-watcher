# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At KubeFortress, we take security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please email **security@kubefortress.io** with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create it, affected versions, and if possible, a mitigation.

## Security Measures

The KubeFortress Rules Checker is designed with security in mind:

1. **No File Storage:** We do not store any of the files uploaded for scanning. All analysis is performed locally in the browser when possible, and any server-side processing immediately deletes files after processing.

2. **Privacy Focus:** We collect minimal information necessary to provide the service.

3. **Secure Communications:** All communications with our services are encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.

4. **Regular Updates:** We regularly update our dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices

When using KubeFortress Rules Checker, please follow these best practices:

1. Ensure you're using the service over HTTPS
2. For highly sensitive files, consider using the client-side scanning option only
3. Keep your browser updated to take advantage of the latest security features
4. Review our Privacy Policy for more information about how we handle your data

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **0-day**: We receive your vulnerability report.
- **1-7 days**: We confirm receipt of your report and begin investigating.
- **7-30 days**: We work on a fix and coordinate with affected parties.
- **30-90 days**: Public disclosure of the vulnerability after a fix has been released.

We may adjust this timeline based on the severity of the vulnerability and other factors.
